CrashCade - (Chris)

Variables:

uint256 public tokensInputted; - Stores the player’s token amount for the round, decided pregame

uint256 public crashPoint; - Randomized multiplier centered around 0.99x determining crash point

bool public gameActive; - Indicates whether a game round is currently active

Methods:

startGame() external;
Initiates a new game round. Resets game parameters and prompts for incoming bets.

inputTokens(uint256 amount, uint256 multiplier) external;
Allows players to input tokens with a specified amount and a prize receipt multiplier. 
Stores the token input amount and multiplier for the player address. Validates that the game round is active and the bet does not exceed player's token balance.

crash() external;
Ends the game upon reaching crashPoint.

Calls startGame().
receivePrize(address player) external;

Allows players to receive their prize if the multiplier hasn't reached the crash point. Settles the round as a win.
Checks the current multiplier against the player's prize receipt multiplier. If successful, credits win amount to player's balance.

setCrashPoint() external;
Sets a randomized crash point centered around 0.99x.
