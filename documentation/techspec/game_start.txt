Complete map of all available games, linking them to their IDs
	curBalance: uint256
Current balance of the current player

Methods:
	allowGame(address player) -> bool
gets the current gas fee of the network the smart contract is deployed on -> curGasFee
gets the current playerâ€™s token balance -> curBalance
returns True if the cost of the game <= curBalance - curGasFee
	startGame(uint256 gameId, address player) -> bool
gets the game by the gameId supplied, storing its token cost in tokenCost
calls allowGame, and if that returns True, prompts the user to sign a transaction at the cost
returns True
