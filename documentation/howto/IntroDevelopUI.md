# Vyper UI Development Guide

This guide outlines the steps for setting up and developing a frontend application using React and ethers.js to interact with a smart contract.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Node.js and NPM installed. The correct blockchain and application must be selected and deployed to get the UI code to correctly link to the blockchain.

## Step 1: Navigate to the UI Folder

Open your terminal and navigate to the `ui` folder where your React project is located.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Modify the UI

Modify your UI with your code. Ensure that it is designed to connect to the blockchain and interact with your smart contract correctly.

## Step 4: Connect to Etherscan

Integrate ethers.js into your project to connect to Etherscan and verify that you can call the correct methods from your deployed smart contract.

## Step 5: Run UI Tests

To run UI tests, execute:
```bash
npx playwright test
```
Ensure all tests pass to confirm that your UI interactions are functioning correctly.

## Step 6: Start Development Server

For development purposes, start your React application by running:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will launch your application on a local server, typically accessible via `http://localhost:3000`.

By following these steps, you will set up and develop a frontend application capable of interacting with a blockchain-based smart contract.
