Rewards Design
- Beneath each image is a token amount representing the price of each token. 
- If a person clicks on an NFT, they are directed to another page which displays a larger version of the NFT image, the cost, and an option to purchase. 

- Next to the Rewards page will be an Owned NFTs page that displays each NFT owned by the user.

- Displayed on the rewards page are images and gifs representing the numerous NFTs that can be exchanged for tokens.
- At any point, the player can click on an icon which will lead them to the rewards page. 
UI:

- NFTs will serve as a fun reward for playing arcade games and will signify how good at arcade games you are.
- We will mint NFTs that can be purchased with tokens.
- Just like a real arcade offers prizes, our game should facilitate transfers between digital tokens and blockchain-based rewards.
