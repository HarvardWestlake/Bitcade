- Just like a real arcade offers prizes, our game should facilitate transfers between digital tokens and blockchain-based rewards.
- We will mint NFTs that can be purchased with tokens.
- NFTs will serve as a fun reward for playing arcade games and will signify how good at arcade games you are.

UI:
- At any point, the player can click on an icon which will lead them to the rewards page. 
- Displayed on the rewards page are images and gifs representing the numerous NFTs that can be exchanged for tokens.
- Beneath each image is a token amount representing the price of each token. 
- If a person clicks on an NFT, they are directed to another page which displays a larger version of the NFT image, the cost, and an option to purchase. 
    - [Click on NFT Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3ZQpFlEkLxNAVNAwPlwIuQ/Blocade-with-Arcade-Theme%3A-Click-on-NFT?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=hZZFe3Abj03fDWwY-0)
- When an NFT is purchased, tokens are removed from the playerâ€™s account and an NFT is transferred to them.
    - [Confirm Payment Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/uOfe6dw9CAVCIwZvFzkN0p/Blocade-with-Arcade-Theme%3A-Click-on-NFT%3A-Confirm-Payment?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=bcMvVnfbXGSYVDu4-0)
- Next to the Rewards page will be an Owned NFTs page that displays each NFT owned by the user.
