1. Overall Theme and Style
Color Scheme: Utilize a dark background with vibrant accent colors (such as electric blue or neon green) to evoke a sense of excitement and digital innovation.
Red lettering on figma kind of hard to read, but I agree with the vibrant accent colors to make it similar to an actual arcade
Make the “Arcade” sign larger and maybe blink it in like a real neon sign
Typography: Use modern, sans-serif fonts for clear readability, with bold headings to catch the user’s attention.
Imagery: Incorporate futuristic, digital-themed graphics and animations that reflect the blockchain technology.
2. Layout and Structure
Header:
Logo on the top left, which acts as a home button.
Navigation menu on the top right, featuring links to Games, How it Works, Wallet, Support, and Account settings.

Where can the users find all the games other than the featured games?
Can probably just have a button that says “View all games” or something like that
How it Works: Brief explainer with an animated infographic showing how blockchain enhances gaming security and fairness.
Footer:
Links to privacy policy, terms of service, and responsible gambling resources.

Shouldn’t it be anonymous?
