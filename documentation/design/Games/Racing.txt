Racing - (Grady+Micah) (this will work for wyrms or horses)

Game Concept:
    Up to 10 people pay tokens to put their racers(Wyrms or horses or other) into a race.
    The fastest wyrm wins all of the tokens except at 10% cut for us.

Game Setup:
    The player starts by sending tokens into the racing game with the address of their racer.
    There will be different brackets of races based off amount paid. They then wait to match up with other racers.

Gameplay:
    Every racer has a speed level based on its overall level and speed level (both of which can be leveled up with tokens).
    Once racers have matched up, they will race with their levels being multiplied by random numbers. 
    The player watches an animation of the racers racing. Every block, the racers will move forward by a distance based off their stats and a random generator.
    The numbers will be random enough that the wyrms will alternate in 1st place.
    The winner fastest racer gets the tokens. Racers will have the opportunity to boost the speed of their wyrm by spending tokens until they reach 50 yards.
    Upon reaching 50 yards the racers that spent tokens will receive a boost in speed.

Random Number Generator:
    Random number generators (which are being created by other coders) are being used to multiply each racer's levels so that the highest level racer doesnâ€™t always win.
