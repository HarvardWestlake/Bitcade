# blocade: The Decentralized Arcade Platform

Welcome to **blocade**, the fully decentralized arcade platform where game logic is powered by blockchain technology. blocade uses the [Ape Framework](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/) and is developed in Vyper, providing a secure and developer-friendly environment for building and deploying games.

## Features

- **Blockchain-based**: All game logic is on-chain for verifiable fairness and transparency.
- **Developer Incentives**: Developers can build front-facing applications and receive a percentage of arcade tickets distributed, promoting a collaborative and rewarding ecosystem.
- **Dynamic Game Library**: Launching with popular titles such as **Crash** and **Blinko**, with plans to expand the library continually.
