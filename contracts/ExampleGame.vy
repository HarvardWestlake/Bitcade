# claudi ai prompt
# in vyper 3.10 can you create a very basic contract which is a game that has 3 methods, getAccountBalance, 
# play and rand. getAccountBalance and rand will interface with 2 other contracts (and will say so via a comment)
# and have commented out code to interface with Rand and Token contracts for the data. In the mean time 
# also put in bogus behavior so this can be run and tested on its own without the dependencies
